# Changelog

All notable changes to the `famon` CLI will be documented in this file.
Library-side changes live in
[`packages/famon_core/CHANGELOG.md`](packages/famon_core/CHANGELOG.md).

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Versioning policy

`famon` (CLI) and `famon_core` (library) version on independent tracks since
2026-05-24. From this version forward, tags use the form `famon-v<version>`
and `famon_core-v<version>` (e.g. `famon-v1.5.1`). Legacy `v<version>` tags
remain in history.

Default release type is **PATCH**. **MINOR** requires a user-visible new
feature. **MAJOR** requires a documented breaking change (CLI flag removal,
output-format change, or runtime behavior change).

## [Unreleased]

<!-- Add entries under: ### Added / Changed / Deprecated / Removed / Fixed / Security -->

## [1.5.1] - 2026-05-24

First release on the decoupled tag scheme — this version tags as
`famon-v1.5.1` (legacy `v*` tags are no longer produced). `famon_core`
moved on its own track at the same time; see
[`packages/famon_core/CHANGELOG.md`](packages/famon_core/CHANGELOG.md)
for library changes.

### Fixed

- Replaced 9 silent `catch (_)` swallows with logged failures (project
  rule: every catch must log or rethrow with context). Affected:
  `ClipboardService.copy` / `paste`,
  `FileDialogService.showSaveDialog`,
  `IssueCommand._getSystemInfo` / `_getDartVersion` /
  `_openBrowserWithCommand`,
  `FamonCommandRunner._checkForUpdates`,
  `KeyboardInputService.stop`,
  `ShortcutsConfigLoader.loadCustomBindings`.
- Coverage badge now points at the `dev` branch (was `main`, which
  meant the README showed a stale or missing badge for unreleased
  work).

### Security

- `.pubignore`: added explicit `firebase-debug.log` entry (defense in
  depth — `*.log` already matches, but the explicit name documents
  intent and survives future ignore-pattern edits).

### Changed

- `tool/update_version.dart` now requires `--package famon | famon_core
  | both`. The previous always-update-both behavior is reachable via
  `--package both` and remains useful for synchronized bumps.
- `tool/release.sh` now requires `<package> <version>` and produces
  per-package tags (`famon-v*`, `famon_core-v*`). Legacy `v*` tag flow
  remains supported by the publish workflow for one release cycle so
  in-flight reverts still work.
- `.github/workflows/publish.yaml`: dispatches per-package publish jobs
  based on tag prefix. Famon CLI only waits for `famon_core` to be
  indexed on pub.dev when both packages publish in the same workflow
  run (legacy single-tag mode).
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file): added `[Unreleased]` placeholder section
  and versioning-policy block. Library entries now live in
  `packages/famon_core/CHANGELOG.md` exclusively from this version
  onward.

## [1.5.0](https://github.com/mikezamayias/famon/compare/v1.4.1...v1.5.0) (2026-05-17)

### Changed

- Refactored `monitor` and `filter` commands to share a single stream-processing pipeline (`MonitoringPipeline`, now part of `famon_core`). Behavior is preserved; per-line cost stays flat.

### Fixed

- `monitor` no longer crashes with `StateError: Stream has already been listened to` on child-process startup. `process.stderr` was being drained twice (outer command setup plus the new pipeline); the outer drain is gone.
- `famon filter --limit N` no longer hangs after the limit is reached. The adb child process is now killed when the pipeline exits early.

### Removed

- Internal: unreachable `HelpCommand`. It was exported from `lib/src/commands/commands.dart` but never registered on `FamonCommandRunner`, so the visible CLI surface is unchanged.

### Internal

- Widened the `injectable` constraint to `>=2.3.5 <4.0.0` so consumers on injectable 3.x are no longer blocked. Local solver still resolves to 2.7.x because `isar_generator` pins `source_gen ^1.2.2`; the concrete 3.x bump arrives with the Isar → Drift migration.
- CI: removed the `|| true` that was swallowing failed `famon_core` test runs, and tightened the Codacy gate so the pipeline file is re-indexed against `dev` without exclusions.
