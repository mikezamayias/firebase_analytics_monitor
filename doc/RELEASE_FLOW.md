# Release Flow

`famon` is a monorepo that publishes two packages to pub.dev:

| Package | Path | Role |
|---|---|---|
| [`famon_core`](https://pub.dev/packages/famon_core) | `packages/famon_core/` | Reusable library (parsing, formatting, persistence) |
| [`famon`](https://pub.dev/packages/famon) | `.` (repo root) | CLI frontend, depends on `famon_core` |

Both packages share a single version. They are released together.

## Branches

- `dev` is the default branch for day-to-day work and pull requests.
- `main` tracks code that has been released to pub.dev.

All feature and fix branches branch from `dev` (e.g. `feature/<name>`, `fix/<name>`) and merge back via pull requests targeting `dev`.

> **Next release must be ≥ 1.4.2.** Both packages are at 1.4.1 on pub.dev — that is the live version. A 1.4.2 attempt was rolled back without ever shipping, so the next bump cannot reuse 1.4.1 and must pick 1.4.2 or later.

### Merge strategy: rebase or squash, never "Create a merge commit"

Repo settings disable "Allow merge commits" — only **Rebase and merge** and **Squash and merge** are available in the GitHub UI. This keeps `dev`'s commit graph linear, easier to review, and easier to bisect.

## Step-by-step

Per the branching protocol, the bump goes through a `chore/release-X.Y.Z` branch off `dev` and lands via a PR back to `dev`. Steps 1–4 happen on that branch; step 5 runs from `dev` after the PR merges.

### 1. Bump every version source atomically

```bash
dart run tool/update_version.dart X.Y.Z
```

`tool/update_version.dart` rewrites four sources in a preflight + apply pipeline so a partial failure leaves the repo untouched:

- `pubspec.yaml` — `version:`
- `pubspec.yaml` — `famon_core: ^X.Y.Z` constraint (kept in lockstep with the library so major bumps stay coherent)
- `packages/famon_core/pubspec.yaml` — `version:`
- `lib/src/version.dart` — `packageVersion` constant

### 2. Update both changelogs

Both packages keep their own changelog (Keep a Changelog format):

- `CHANGELOG.md` — root, end-user-facing CLI changes.
- `packages/famon_core/CHANGELOG.md` — library API changes.

Add a new `## [X.Y.Z](COMPARE_LINK) (YYYY-MM-DD)` section to each, where
`COMPARE_LINK` is `https://github.com/mikezamayias/famon/compare/vPREVIOUS...vX.Y.Z`.
If a release only touches the CLI, the `famon_core` entry can simply note
"no functional changes — version bumped to track CLI release."

You can draft and validate both sections with the maintainer-only helper.
The safe default is to generate and review the prompt first:

```bash
dart run tool/changelog.dart prompt X.Y.Z
```

If the prompt looks reasonable, explicitly opt in to the LLM call:

```bash
dart run tool/changelog.dart draft X.Y.Z --llm codex --yes
dart run tool/changelog.dart validate X.Y.Z
```

The helper only drafts text and validates formatting. Review the generated
entries before committing the release-prep PR. The LLM path is guarded by
`--yes`, a prompt-size budget, a short timeout, and fenced untrusted release
data so commit messages and pull request titles are treated as data rather than
instructions. Codex runs read-only with user config/rules ignored; Claude runs
with no tools allowed. Do not bypass these safeguards or paste raw release
history into an LLM prompt manually.

### 3. Run pre-push checks

Per the project's branching protocol, every push runs format, analyzer (with `--fatal-warnings`), and the full test suite locally first. For a release commit, also dry-run both packages:

```bash
dart format --set-exit-if-changed .
dart analyze --fatal-warnings
dart test
(cd packages/famon_core && dart pub publish --dry-run)
dart pub publish --dry-run
```

The dry-runs should report zero warnings. A `dependency_overrides` hint is expected on the root `famon` package — it carries the local `path: packages/famon_core` override, which pub strips from the published pubspec but warns about during dry-run.

### 4. Commit, push the release branch, open the PR

Stage explicitly (no `git add -A`):

```bash
git add pubspec.yaml packages/famon_core/pubspec.yaml lib/src/version.dart \
        CHANGELOG.md packages/famon_core/CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore(release): X.Y.Z"
git push -u origin chore/release-X.Y.Z
gh pr create --base dev --title "chore(release): X.Y.Z" --fill
```

`pr_publish_check.yaml` runs on the PR and re-runs the version cross-check, both `dart pub publish --dry-run`s, and the `famon_core` example smoke run. Wait for it to go green, then merge the PR via the GitHub UI (or `gh pr merge`).

### 5. Open the release-sync PR and tag

After the release-prep PR (`chore/release-X.Y.Z`) merges into `dev`, switch to `dev`, pull, then run the helper from a clean working tree:

```bash
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev --ff-only
./tool/release.sh X.Y.Z
```

The helper is **PR-based**. It opens (or reuses) a `dev → main` pull request, waits for the required status checks to pass, merges the PR with the "merge" method so dev's commits become ancestors of main, then tags the resulting merge commit and pushes the tag. The "Protect main" repository ruleset rejects direct pushes to `main` for everyone, including admins — the release flow earns its merge the same way every other change does.

`tool/release.sh X.Y.Z` does:

1. **Guards**: working tree must be clean; both `dev` and `main` must exist locally and match their `origin/...` counterparts; all six version sources match `X.Y.Z`:
   - root `pubspec.yaml` `version:`
   - root `pubspec.yaml` `famon_core: ^X.Y.Z` constraint
   - `packages/famon_core/pubspec.yaml` `version:`
   - root `CHANGELOG.md` has a `## [X.Y.Z]` heading
   - `packages/famon_core/CHANGELOG.md` has a `## [X.Y.Z]` heading
   - `lib/src/version.dart` has `const packageVersion = 'X.Y.Z';`
2. **Find or open the PR**: looks for an existing open PR with `base=main, head=dev`. If none, opens one titled `chore(release): X.Y.Z → main`. The body asks the merger to use **Create a merge commit** — `tool/release.sh` requests this explicitly so dev's commits are preserved as main's ancestors. Squash would orphan dev's history relative to main and reintroduce the divergence this flow exists to prevent.
3. **Wait for CI**: `gh pr checks <N> --watch --required` blocks until every required status check has finished. Required checks are the six configured on the "Protect main" ruleset: `build / build`, `Analyze + format + test (famon_core) / build`, `Verify version sources agree`, `dart pub publish --dry-run (famon)`, `dart pub publish --dry-run (famon_core)`, and `Codacy Static Code Analysis`. A failed check exits the script with status 1 — fix the failure and re-run.
4. **Merge the PR**: `gh pr merge <N> --merge`. Fails if `mergeStateStatus` is anything but `CLEAN/MERGEABLE` (e.g. unresolved review threads).
5. **Pull main locally** and verify the merged tree still has `version: X.Y.Z` on every file.
6. **Tag and push**: creates an annotated `vX.Y.Z` tag on the new `main` HEAD and pushes the tag. The tag push triggers `.github/workflows/publish.yaml`.

If you use the **Manual Release** GitHub Actions workflow instead of running `tool/release.sh` locally, the workflow dispatches `publish.yaml` and `github-release.yaml` explicitly after creating the tag. This is required because tags pushed by `GITHUB_TOKEN` do not trigger follow-up `push` workflows.

## Automated publish workflow

Tag pushes trigger two independent workflows in parallel:

- `.github/workflows/publish.yaml` — publishes both packages to pub.dev (this section).
- `.github/workflows/github-release.yaml` — creates a GitHub Release with the changelog body.

`publish.yaml` runs three jobs in sequence:

1. **`verify-versions`** — fails fast if the tag, root `pubspec.yaml`, `packages/famon_core/pubspec.yaml`, and `lib/src/version.dart` disagree, or if any source is empty.
2. **`publish-core`** — `dart pub publish --dry-run` then `--force` for `famon_core`.
3. **`publish-cli`** — polls `https://pub.dev/api/packages/famon_core` until the new version appears (up to 5 minutes), then publishes the root `famon` package.

The CLI cannot publish before the library because the published `famon` pubspec resolves `famon_core: ^X.Y.Z` from pub.dev (the local `dependency_overrides` is stripped on publish).

### Recovery from a partial publish

Pub.dev does not allow re-publishing the same version. If `publish-core` succeeds but `publish-cli` fails, `famon_core@X.Y.Z` is on pub.dev permanently and the CLI half is still missing. Recover by:

1. Investigating the `publish-cli` failure (typically transient pub.dev 5xx or indexing latency).
2. Bumping to the next patch (e.g. `1.4.3`) so both packages can be re-cut. Both packages always release together — `famon_core` will be re-published at the new patch even if its source is unchanged. Note this in the `famon_core` CHANGELOG as "version bumped to track CLI release."

### Authentication

Both publish jobs use OIDC trusted publishing (`permissions: id-token: write` plus `dart-lang/setup-dart@v1`, no `PUB_TOKEN` env var). Both packages have GitHub Actions trusted publishing enabled on their pub.dev admin page with:

- Repository: `mikezamayias/famon`
- Tag pattern: `v{{version}}`
- Enabled events: `push` only
- Require GitHub Actions environment: off
- GCP service account: off

**Trusted publishing cannot be configured for a package that does not yet exist on pub.dev.** The very first publish of a new package must be done manually (see [Manual publish](#manual-publish) below); after the package appears on pub.dev, return to its admin page and enable Automated publishing.

## Continuous integration on PRs

`.github/workflows/pr_publish_check.yaml` runs on every PR (and push to `dev`/`main`) that touches publish-relevant files (`pubspec.yaml`, `lib/src/version.dart`, `packages/famon_core/**`, `.pubignore`, `tool/update_version.dart`, `tool/release.sh`, the publish workflows). It runs four jobs:

- `verify-versions-consistent` — same cross-check as the tag-time job, minus the tag comparison.
- `dry-run-famon-core` and `dry-run-famon` — `dart pub publish --dry-run` for both packages, catching publish-blocking issues before tagging.
- `example-smoke-run` — executes `packages/famon_core/example/famon_core_example.dart` to keep the published example honest.

## Manual publish

Required for the very first publish of either package (pub.dev cannot configure trusted publishing for a package that does not yet exist), and useful as a recovery path if the workflow is unavailable:

```bash
dart pub login
(cd packages/famon_core && dart pub publish)
sleep 60
dart pub publish
```

## Dependabot

Dependabot pull requests target `dev`. Group or defer dependency updates as needed. Keep release-specific changes (version bump and changelogs) in a dedicated `chore(release)` commit.
